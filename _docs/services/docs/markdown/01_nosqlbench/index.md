# nosqlbench docs

Welcome to the documentation for nosqlbench. nosqlbench is a power tool that emulates real application workloads. This means that you can fast-track performance, sizing and data model testing without writing your own testing harness.

nosqlbench endeavors to be valuable to all users. We do this by making it easy for you, our user, to do just what you need without worrying about the rest. If you need to do something simple, it should be simple to find the right settings and just do it. If you need something more sophisticated, then you should be able to find what you need with a reasonable amount of effort and no surprises.

Doing this well requires a coordinated effort in how the tools are documented and layered. We're just getting started with the bundled
docs that you are reading now. Look for new and expanded content in this guidebook with each release. We will be adding docs for more advanced users to unlock based on a how-to format.

We take requests! If you have specific nosqlbench topics you'd like to
have added to this guidebook, please make a request as described under the Support Options section.
