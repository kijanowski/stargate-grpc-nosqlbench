# Adding Scenarios

All of the named scenarios that are bundled with NoSQLBench are simply
named yaml files with scenarios included.

If you are a developer and want to add one of these, you can submit a pull
request to the main project. However, to be accepted, any named scenario
should follow all the conventions described in the main
_Designing Workloads_ documentation, including naming, tagging, and
default values.

If you are not a developer, and you have come up with a workload that
you'd like to make part of the standard NoSQLBench distribution, you can
add it to an issue on the main issue tracker.
