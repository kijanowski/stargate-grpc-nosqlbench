# Getting Support

These guidelines are mirrored at the [Submitting Feedback](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/wiki/Submitting-Feedback)
wiki page at the nosqlbench project site, which is also where any `[Submit Feedback]` links should will take you.

## Bug Fixes

If you think you have found a bug, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug).
nosqlbench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources permit. Bugs reports which are
more detailed, or bug reports which include steps to reproduce will get attention first.

## Feature Requests

If you would like to see something in nosqlbench that is not there yet,
please [submit a feature request](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=feature).

## Documentation Requests

If you would like to see a specific nosqlbench or testing topic added to the guidebook, please
[request docs content](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=docs).
