# Binary Format

nosqlbench is distributed primarily as a binary for Linux distributions. This is the
easiest way to use. The nosqlbench binary includes its own OpenJDK runtime.

It should work for most modern Linux distributions. The only requirement is that fuse be
installed (it is usually already present) on the client system.

You can download the binary directly from the releases section of the nosqlbench
project site: [NoSQLBench Releases](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/releases)
