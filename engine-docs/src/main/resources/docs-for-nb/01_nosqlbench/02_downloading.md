title: Getting NoSQLBench
weight: 3
---

NoSQLBench is packaged directly as a Linux binary named `nb` and as
an executable Java jar named `nb.jar`.

The Linux binary is recommended, since it comes with its own
JVM and eliminates the need to manage Java downloads. Both can be obtained
at the releases section of the main NoSQLBench project:

- [NoSQLBench Releases](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/releases)


:::info
Once you download the binary, you may need to `chmod +x nb` to make it
executable.

:::info
If you choose to use the nb.jar instead of the binary, it is recommended
to run it with at least Java 12.
