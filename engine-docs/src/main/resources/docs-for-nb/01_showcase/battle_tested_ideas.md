# Refined Core Concepts

The core concepts that NoSQLBench is built on have been scrutinized, replaced, refined, and hardened through several
years of use by users of various needs and backgrounds.

This is important when trying to find a way to express common patterns in what is often a highly fragmented practice.
Testing is hard. Scale testing is hard. Distributed testing is hard. We need a set of conceptual building blocks that
can span across workloads and system types, and machinery to put these concepts to use. Some concepts used in NoSQLBench
are shared below for illustration, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

### The Cycle

Cycles in NoSQLBench are whole numbers on a number line. All operations in a NoSQLBench session are derived from a
single cycle. It's a long value, and a seed. The cycle determines not only which statements (of those available) will
get executed, but it also determines what the values bound to that statement will be.

Cycles are specified as a closed-open `[min,max)` interval, just as slices in some languages. That is, the min value is
included in the range, but the max value is not. This means that you can stack slices using common numeric reference
points without overlaps or gaps. It means you can have exact awareness of what data is in your dataset, even
incrementally.

You can think of a cycle as a single-valued coordinate system for data that lives adjacent to that number on the number
line.

### The Activity

An activity is a multi-threaded flywheel of statements in some sequence and ratio. Activities run over the numbers in a
cycle range. Each activity has a driver type which determines the native protocol that it speaks.

### The Activity Type

An activity type is a high level driver for a protocol. It is like a statement-aware cartridge that knows how to take a
basic statement template and turn it into an operation for the scenario to execute.

### The Scenario

The scenario is a runtime session that holds the activities while they run. A NoSQLBench scenario is responsible for
aggregating global runtime settings, metrics reporting channels, logfiles, and so on.

### The Scenario Script

Each scenario is governed by a script runs single-threaded, asynchronously from activities, but in control of
activities. If needed, the scenario script is automatically created for the user, and the user never knows it is there.
If the user has advanced testing requirements, then they may take advantage of the scripting capability at such time.
When the script exits, *AND* all activities are complete, then the scenario is complete..
