Since NoSQLBench is new on the scene in its current form, you may be wondering
why you would want to use it over any other tool. That is what this section is all
about.

First, a brief overview, vis-a-vis some tools you may have already used.

NoSQLBench can do everything that other testing tools can do, and more. It
achieves this by focusing on a scalable user experience in combination with a
modular internal architecture.

NoSQLBench is a workload construction and simulation tool for scalable systems
testing. That is an entirely different scope of endeavor than most other tools.
