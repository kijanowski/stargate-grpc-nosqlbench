# NoSQLBench Showcase

Since NoSQLBench is new on the scene in its current form, you may be
wondering why you would want to use it over any other tool. That is what
this section is all about.

You don't have to read all of this! It is here for those who want to know
the answer to the question "So, what's the big deal??" Just remember it is
here for later if you want to skip to the next section and get started
testing.

NoSQLBench can do nearly everything that other testing tools can do, and
more. It achieves this by focusing on a scalable user experience in
combination with a modular internal architecture.

NoSQLBench is a workload construction and simulation tool for scalable
systems testing. That is an entirely different scope of endeavor than most
other tools.

The pages in this section all speak to a selection of advanced
capabilities that are unique to NoSQLBench.
