# NoSQLBench Showcase

Since NoSQLBench is new on the scene in its current form, you may be wondering why you would want to use it over any
other tool. That is what this section is all about.

If you want to look under the hood of this toolkit before giving it a spin, this section is for you. You don't have to
read all of this! It is here for those who want to know the answer to the question "So, what's the big deal??" Just
remember it is here for later if you want to skip to the next section and get started testing.

NoSQLBench can do nearly everything that other testing tools can do, and more. It achieves this by focusing on a
scalable user experience in combination with a modular internal architecture.

NoSQLBench is a workload construction and simulation tool for scalable systems testing. That is an entirely different
scope of endeavor than most other tools.

The pages in this section all speak to advanced capabilities that are unique to NoSQLBench. In time, we want to show
these with basic scenario examples, right in the docs.
