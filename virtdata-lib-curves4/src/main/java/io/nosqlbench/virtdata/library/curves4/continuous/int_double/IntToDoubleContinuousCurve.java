/*
 * Generate samples according to the specified probability density.
 *
 * The input value consists of a long between 0L and Long.MAX_VALUE.
 * This value is scaled to the unit interval (0.0, 1.0) as
 * an index into a sampling function. The method used is
 * inverse cumulative density sampling.
 *
 * <H3>Sampling Mode</H3>
 *
 * The curve can be sampled in either map or hash mode. Map mode
 * simply indexes into the probability curve in the order that
 * it would appear on a density plot. Hash mode applies a
 * murmur3 hash to the input value before scaling from the
 * range of longs to the unit interval, thus providing a pseudo-random
 * sample of a value from the curve. This is usually what you want,
 * so hash mode is the default.  To enable map mode, simply provide
 * "map" as one of the modifiers as explained below.
 *
 * <H3>Interpolation</H3>
 *
 * The curve can be computed from the sampling function for each value
 * generated, or it can be provided via interpolation with a lookup table.
 * Using interpolation makes all the generator functions perform the
 * same. This is almost always what you want, so interpolation is
 * enabled by default. In order to compute the value for every sample
 * instead, simply provide "compute" as one of the modifiers as explained
 * below.
 *
 * <H3>Clamping</H3>
 *
 * Some of the provided distributions may yield extreme values which
 * are out of the useful range for many tests. If you want these values
 * to be clamped to be within 2^63 as a maximum, then the default
 * clamping behavior will do this. If you want to have higher values
 * up to and including IEEE Infinity, then use the 'noclamp' option.
 *
 * You can add optional modifiers after the distribution parameters.
 * You can add one of 'hash' or 'map' but not both. If neither of these is
 * added, 'hash' is implied as a default.
 * You can add one of 'interpolate' or 'compute' but not both. If neither
 * of these is added, 'interpolate' is implied as a default.
 * You can add one of 'clamp' or 'noclamp' but not both. if neither of
 * these is added, 'clamp' is implied as a default.
 *
 * At times, it might be useful to add 'hash', 'interpolate', or 'clamp'
 * to your specifiers as a form of verbosity or explicit specification.
