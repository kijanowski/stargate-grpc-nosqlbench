/**
 * <H2>Synopsis</H2>
 *
 * <p>This iterator breaks some rules! The intent of this iterator is to
 * make it programmatically easy to consume raw data in ByteBuffer mode
 * without throwing away generated data. The efficiency loss of throwing
 * away data is variable, but two reason are used as premise for this
 * approach: 1) generation is not free and 2) the buf size mismatch
 * between producer and consumer could be very high, amplifying the generation
 * cost of data.</p>
 *
 * <p>Yet, the iterable pattern is very easy to integrate with, and so long
 * as the user understands what this iterable does, it should make things
 * easier by far than *not* having this helper class.</p>
 *
 * <p>All this iterator does is wrap another iterator and cache the current
 * ByteBuffer, re-issuing it until it is consumed fully.</p>
 *
 * <H2>Usage Patterns</H2>
 *
 * This is intended to be called as an interative data source, where another
 * iteration controls flow.
 *
 * <H2>Warnings</H2>
 *
 * This class is not thread safe. Either wrap it in a ThreadLocal with appropriate
 * initialization for concurrent use, or make sure no concurrent access occurs.
