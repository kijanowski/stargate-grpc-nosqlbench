Functions in this category are meant to provide easy grab-and-go functions that are tailored for real-world simulation.
This library will grow over time. These functions are often built directly on top of other functions in the core
libraries. However, they are provided here for simplicity in workload construction. They perform exactly the same as
their longer-form equivalents.
